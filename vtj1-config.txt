### Instructions:
# This file, vtj1-config.txt, is the main build-time configuration file
# for the VTJ-1 terminal.  You can edit these settings to alter its
# behavior.  See also vtj1-overview.txt and vtj1-design.txt.
# 
# This file's contents are mostly not used directly, instead they're
# translated by 'vtj1-config-gen.tcl' into three files, vtj1-config.asm
# and vtj1-config.v and vtj1-config.cooked, used by the software and
# "hardware" (RTL) parts of VTJ-1, and its supporting scripts, respectively.
#
# Syntactically, this file consists of name=value pairs, comments, and
# blank lines.  Anything beginning with '#' is a comment.  Unrecognized
# names will be ignored.  There is no way to spread a value onto multiple
# lines.  Most of the values are simple booleans (0 for no, 1 for yes)
# or numbers anyway.

### Settings, with explanations for each:
font=freebsd-boot-font-vt
    # font= Name of the font to use, as recognized by vtj1fonter.tcl,
    # which see.  Generally the '-vt' variants of the fonts are the ones
    # that should be used.  Some fonts may depend on external software and
    # may be subject to the copyrights and license terms of that
    # external software.
    # 
    # Suggested values: lat1-12-vt; cafe-12-vt;
    # sony-8x16-vt; freebsd-boot-font-vt.
    # 
    # I personally like "lat1-12-vt" the best, but you have to have the
    # font installed on your build machine at
    # "/usr/share/consolefonts/lat1-12.psf.gz" to use it.
fpga_platform=papilio_pro_arcade
    # fpga_platform= The FPGA platform that VTJ-1 is running on.  Possibilities:
    #       papilio_pro_arcade -
    #           Gadget Factory's "Papilio Pro" board paired with their
    #           "Arcade MegaWing."
    #       pepino_lx9 -
    #           Saanlima's "Pepino" board, LX9 version.
    # In the future other platforms may be supported.
baudrate=115200 # The default baud rate for VTJ-1 to use, which may be
                # changed at runtime in the menu (if enabled).  This may
                # only take a limited set of values, but that set includes
                # most of the standard baud rates.
clock_rate=77 # Clock rate in MHz.  The following values are currently
              # accepted on Papilio:
              #     25 - 25MHz; close to 1x the VGA pixel rate
              #     50 - 50MHz; close to 2x the VGA pixel rate
              #     51 - 51.2MHz; close to 2x the VGA pixel rate and
              #          slightly higher than 50, and may work better
              #          for some displays
              #     75 - 74.7MHz; close to 3x the VGA pixel rate
              #     77 - 76.8MHz; close to 3x the VGA pixel rate and
              #          slightly higher than 75, and may work better
              #          for some displays
              # and on Pepino:
              #     25 - 25MHz; close to 1x the VGA pixel rate
              #     50 - 50MHz; close to 2x the VGA pixel rate
              #     75 - 75MHz; close to 3x the VGA pixel rate
              # Higher clock rates are preferable; lower ones can have
              # trouble with higher baud rates.
writeable_rom=0 # The VTJ-1's software resides in memory which I'll call "ROM"
                # because there's usually no need to write to it.  But
                # when developing VTJ-1's software, it's convenient to be
                # able to write to it.
                # A '0' makes it read-only.
                # A '1' makes it writeable.
                # If you're going to use reload.tcl, you need a '1' here
big_rom=0 # The VTJ-1's software currently fits into 8kB of memory.
          # But if you're expanding it somehow you might need more.
          # A '0' makes it 8kB
          # A '1' makes it 16kB
writeable_font=0 # The VTJ-1's font memory doesn't normally need to be
                 # writable either.  But it can be.
                 # A '0' makes it read-only
                 # A '1' makes it writeable
big_ram=0 # The VTJ-1's software only needs to use 1kB for data memory
          # (not counting video memory) but it's possible to get more
          # if desired.
          # A '0' makes it 1kB
          # A '1' makes it 2kB
font_256_chars=0 # VTJ-1 currently only uses 128 characters of the font,
                 # but is capable of taking 256 character fonts.  This
                 # changes the format of the font as well as the size
                 # of the memory used to hold it.  After changing this
                 # you'll have to put a new font.mem file in place.
                 # vtj1fonter.tcl can generate one.  It can be run
                 # via 'make font.mem'.
                 # A '0' makes it 128 characters in 2kB memory
                 # A '1' makes it 256 characters in 4kB memory
visible_bell=1 # When a BEL character is received, VTJ-1 can display it
               # visually by flashing the screen.
               # A '0' disables this
               # A '1' enables it
audible_bell=1 # When a BEL character is received, VTJ-1 can indicate it
               # by a beep tone, if the physical hardware permits.
               # A '0' disables this
               # A '1' enables it
devel_escapes=1 # Enables some VTJ-1 specific "developer" escape codes
                # (of the form "\033[...|").  In normal use they just
                # take up space and may even be considered insecure.
                # While developing VTJ-1 software they can be useful.
                # A '0' disables them
                # A '1' enables them
                # If you're going to use reload.tcl, you need a '1' here
devel_escapes_2=0 # Enables some further VTJ-1 specifc "developer" escape
                  # codes, beyond the ones covered by 'devel_escapes'.
                  # If 'devel_escapes' is not also enabled, this will have
                  # no effect.
                  # A '0' disables them
                  # A '1' enables them
                  # They're not usually useful
progdelay=0 # Enables a further VTJ-1 "developer" escape code to
            # set a programmable delay to slow down VTJ-1 for testing.
            # If 'devel_escapes' is not also enabled, this won't
            # do much good.
            # A '0' disables it
            # A '1' enables it
bufhwm=0 # Enables code to track the "high water mark" of the
         # input buffer, for debugging it.
         # A '0' disables it
         # A '1' enables it
video_timing_tester=0 # VTJ-1 has a "video timing tester" device which
                      # helps in debugging the video device.  It's not
                      # used normally.
                      # A '0' leaves it out.
                      # A '1' includes it.
menu=1 # Enables a handy on-screen menu on the VTJ-1.
       # A '0' disable it
       # A '1' enables it
menu_lowbauds=0 # Include low (<9600) baud rates in the VTJ-1's on screen
                # menu.  While these are annoyingly slow in the present
                # day, they were used historically and there may be
                # occasions when they're desired.
                # A '0' disables it
                # A '1' enables it
pgalign=1 # Enables alignment of some lookup tables to 256 byte boundaries
          # in VTJ-1's memory.  This might increase performance at the
          # expense of a few bytes of memory.
          # A '0' disables it
          # A '1' enables it
